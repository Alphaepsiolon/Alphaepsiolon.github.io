In my free time however, I like to write, get down and dirty with some fly-wheel pottery and play the piano. I've added my contact information below, so don't hesitate to reach out! I tend to be charmingly talkative when the stakes are low.

I'd prefer if you contacted me via email, but do feel free to reach on on my socials (links on the sidebar).
